# Python-Project-16-USB-Backup-System
In this video, I demonstrate how to create an automatic USB backup system using Python. This project is perfect for automating file backups whenever a USB drive is connected to your computer.

In this tutorial, we will:
- Detect USB drives connected to the system using Python.
- Copy files from the USB drive to a designated backup folder.
- Implement logic to monitor and detect new USB drives in real-time.
- Ensure all files and folders from the USB are backed up securely.
